0. The base is the number of digits that a counting system uses to represent numbers. Example: Binary uses 2 digits, 1 and 0

1. Binary is the base 2 counting system. We care because the system is simpler to work with and is less expensive than larger bases.

2. Let D = decimal
let d = digit in binary number

D = (d*2^d) + (d*2^d) + (d*2^d) + (d*2^d) ... + (d*2^d)

3.
  1. Divide # by 2
  2. Use integer quotient for next cycle
  3. Use remainder for binary digit (right to left)
  4. Repeat until quotient equals 0


Example: 4 to binary

     Quotient Remainder
4/2 |   2    |   0
    |        |
2/2 |   1    |   0
    |        |
1/2 |   0    |   1


Answer = 100
