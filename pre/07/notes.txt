An array is a sequence of values and the values in the array are called elements
All values in an array must have the same type

Example
int[] counts
double[] values

You have to use the new operator to create the array
counts = new int[4]

The [] operator selects elements from the array 
counts[0] returns the first element

You can't directly print arrays you would need some kind of method to display it

If we copy an array, any change made to one will be seen by the other
If we want a new array and not a reference, we have to create a new array and copy the elements
from the old to the new

We can get the length of an array using the .length property

Looping through the elements of an array is called traversal. Another way is search which traverses
an array looking for a particular element. Another traversal is a reduce operation which reduces an array
of values down to single value ex. finding the sum of the elements

java.util.Random produces pseudorandom numbers

We can rewrite the loop to display elements of an array using this
for (int value : values) {
    System.out.println(value);
}
